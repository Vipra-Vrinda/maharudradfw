            "text": "Volunteering at MahaRudra DFW 2025 at such a formative age has turned to be a very transformative experience that has yielded many spiritual fruits and has taught me many important lessons. As a youth it is easy to question - am I even worthy enough to make a meaningful contribution to this event? After all, the MahaRudra is an age old tradition run only by very wise and experienced Brahmins and priests. And the majority people in my age group are solely focused on personal and financial advancement, not spiritual - and therefore may not have the requisite experience or knowledge to provide any meaningful contribution to such an event. However this experience has taught me the opposite - that age is not a barrier to true service, and can actually be a great motivating factor for everyone alike - young and young at heart. For what we lack in knowledge - we make up for with ideas. What we lack in tradition - we make up for in creativity. And what we lack in experience - we make up for in enthusiasm. With Bhagwan himself acting through Subramanya Uncle and the rest of the Vipra Vrinda volunteers, they became the very embodiment of the Lord: compassionate and flexible enough to be willing to infuse the traditional with new ideas, yet uncompromising and unyielding in the spiritual sanctity and traditional values of the event, giving rise to the MahaRudra Yajña. In all our lives, one must have done an enormous amount of cumulative punya to even witness such an occasion, let alone take part in one alongside the workers of the frontline. With all of our collective skillsets, I am sure this MahaRudra Yajña will be a spiritual spectacle that will be remembered in the years to come."
